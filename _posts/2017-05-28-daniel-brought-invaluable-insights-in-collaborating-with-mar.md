> Daniel brought invaluable insights in collaborating with marketing and played a critical management role in helping to determine the strategy of sales and engineering projects. He is inquisitive and takes a holistic approach to his work, making sure that all aspects of the product and user experience are considered. On a personal note, I found Daniel to be extraordinarily kind, sincere, inclusive, and a pleasure to work with.
