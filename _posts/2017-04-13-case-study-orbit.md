# Case Study: Orbit

Risk Mitigation, Navigation Models, and Extensive User Research

A popular methodology known as Jobs to Be Done defines a product as something one hires to get a job done. I love this analogy because it inevitably sparks team curiosity and user research activities. The more one strives to understand the job a user is wants to achieve, the easier it is to build a product, through shared understanding, and subsequent acceleration of development and delivery.

This analogy is fantastic when creating new products, but when changing an existing product, care must be taken not to disrupt the existing user base. I've crossed this threshold a number of times, however, the most robust and successful experience I've had was during my time at VMware, when I worked closely with the designer Peter Shepherd.
