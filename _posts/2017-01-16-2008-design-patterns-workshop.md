# Reflections: Design Patterns Workshop

## Cool people. First time.

I was contracted to prepare and deliver a two day workshop on design patterns in ActionScript for Java and PHP developers at the Israeli startup Dapper, later acquired by YAHOO. This was the first time I led a group of developers and I was quite nervous.

I believe in learning by doing and so I designed the workshop to titrate between lecture and self paced labs. Infact, this workshop pattern has been so rewarding that I've replicated it almost everywhere I gone since, including at [VMware][0], [SpringPath][1], WatchDox, meetups I've organized, Exploros, and most recently at Honeyfund.

This was a lab style workshop for which I prepared a lecture and exercises and then coded the MVC portion on the fly.
