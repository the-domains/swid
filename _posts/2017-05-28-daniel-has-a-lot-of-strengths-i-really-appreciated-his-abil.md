> Daniel has a lot of strengths. I really appreciated his ability to improve Honeyfund's process to keep our team on track and plan for future projects. Daniel's leadership was instrumental in launching the Honeyfund Gift Card, a new line of business for us. His wealth of experience in Design Thinking and practical Agile processes were a great asset at Honeyfund.
