# Abe's Market Acquired!

Abe's Market was one of the early market places for natural and organic products. I It was in production at [http://www.abesmarket.com][0] and as architect and development lead, I designed an early cloud solution on Amazon Web Services and CentOS for high availability and scalability. I also deployed a uniform development environment, issue management system, SVN, and led Magento development.

I check in on past projects from time to time and have been delighted to witness the success of Abe's Market. This week [their brand was acquired][1]. I recall admiring the founders' shift and focus on what they believed in after many years at a large fortune 500 healthcare company, that some might have confused as industrial chemical company ^\_^

I think of all the passionate people behind the wholesome organic product companies who were enabled by Abe's Market and I'm certain it is a good feeling for the founder as it is for me to know that I contributed towards their cumulative success.

My gift and joy is project inception. Ramp up was 0 to 60 in literally a few weeks including evaluation and due diligence of key technical infrastructure such as Magento for ecommerce, hosting with AWS, server architecture and orchestration, security and disaster recovery plans, all aspects of development environment, code security, remote team coordination, and much more.

Software development is complex with many moving parts, yet it can be a pure joy with a good attitude, good people, and sharp dedication towards business outcomes. Especially memorable on this project was working with former head architect of Magento, who is now founder of [Sellvana][2]---nextgen ecommerce platform.

Don't build your future on sand. Your software infrastructure, company culture, team collaboration, commitment to quality, and dedication to delivering customer value are the foundation of your company.
