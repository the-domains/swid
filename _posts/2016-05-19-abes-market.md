[They were recently acquired by DirectEats][0] and I'm happy to see how successful this marketplace had become. I recall admiring the founders wanting to focus on what they actually believed in after working years at a large fortune 500 healthcare company (aka industrial chemical company).

That's certainly what the founders of Abe's Market did and organic food has come a long way since then. When I think of all the small organic product companies who were enabled by Abe's Market, it is a good feeling to know that I contributed towards their cumulative success, that's the power of quality software.

My gift and joy is project inception. Ramp up was 0 to 60 in literally a few weeks including evaluation and selection of key technical infrastructure such as Magento for ecommerce, hosting with AWS, server architecture and orchestration, security and disaster recovery plans, all aspects of development environment, code security, remote consultant coordination, and much more.

Software development is complex with many moving parts, yet it can be a pure joy with a good attitude, and good people. Especially memorable on this project was working with former head architect of Magento, who is now founder of [Sellvana][1]---check it out!

Don't build your future on sand. Your software infrastructure, company culture, team collaboration, commitment to quality, and dedication to delivering customer value are the foundation of your company.
