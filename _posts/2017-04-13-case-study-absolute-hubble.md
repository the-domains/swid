# Case Study: Absolute Hubble

## Designing for Scale

There's a rule of thumb I keep in mind when I approach a design problem. 
> 
> Every order of magnitude of object quantity has a different solution space. 

You've experienced this first hand as search and tagging have become dominant patterns as the number of files you manage on digital devices has grown by leaps and bounds. Now consider enterprise organizations such as hospitals and large businesses, governments and data centers. Operating such organizations might include petabytes of storage and trillions of files. 

I became acquainted with this rule of thumb at VMware as member of the R&D User Experience group. VMware is responsible for revolutionizing IT by bringing virtualization to the consumer market. Virtualization was invented by IBM in the late 60's and is the foundation of cloud computing. Operating the infrastructure of today's modern clouds include many virtual object abstractions defined above the many physical devices (CPUs, drives, switches) that provide compute, storage, and networking resources. 

Just as the files you use have grown, the quantity of virtual objects to be managed has also grown. It was not uncommon, at VMware for many of our customers to be reaching nearly 10,000 virtual machines and in some cases an order of magnitude above. VMware's VSphere product, which is akin to an operating system for data centers 

At VMware I worked on an advanced visualization projects we coined Absolute Hubble, as in the Hubble space telescope. The intention was to help cloud administrators to quickly understand the relationship between the virtual objects they manage. 

such as resource pools, 

that led to design patents. including we understood that some of our large customers were managing upwards of 100 thousand virtual machines across many data centers 

I worked on some interesting designs at VMware including Orbit which you can read about here flagship Many of our 

During my time at VMware flagship product is known as vSphere, which you can think of as an operating system for the modern datacenter. Just as the number of files on your computer has grown to millions, the number of virtual machines in a data center operators at that you can no longer keep track of. Many of our enterprise customers such as hospitals, governments, and datacenter operators
