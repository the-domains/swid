# Case Study: Absolute Hubble

## Designing for Scale

There's a rule of thumb I keep in mind when I approach a design problem.

> Every order of magnitude in the number of objects has a different solution space. 

You've experienced this first hand as the tools and software you use have changed and adapted to the amount of storage and number of files individuals. Now consider enterprise organizations such as hospitals and large businesses, governments and data centers. Operating such organizations might include petabytes of storage and trillions of files. 

I learned this first hand at VMware as member of the R&D User Experience group. VMware is responsible for revolutionizing IT by bringing virtualization to the consumer market. Virtualization was invented by IBM in the late 60's and is the foundation of modern cloud computing. Just as the files and storage you use, operating those enterprise organizations have their own problems. 

At VMware I worked on some advanced visualization projects that led to design patents. including we understood that some of our large customers were managing upwards of 100 thousand virtual machines across many data centers 

I worked on some interesting designs at VMware including Orbit which you can read about here flagship Many of our 

During my time at VMware flagship product is known as vSphere, which you can think of as an operating system for the modern datacenter. Just as the number of files on your computer has grown to millions, the number of virtual machines in a data center operators at that you can no longer keep track of. Many of our enterprise customers such as hospitals, governments, and datacenter operators
